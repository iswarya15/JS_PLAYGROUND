# Functional Programming

## Pure Functions

`Pure Functions` cannot modify anything outside of itself(No Side-effects). They _do not change any data passed into them_, but create _new data to return_ without altering the original.

**Side Effect**: **change of system state or any observable interaction** with outside world that occurs during the calculation of a result.

### Side effect may include

- changing the file system
- inserting a record into a database
- making an http call
- mutations
- printing to the screen / logging
- obtaining user input
- querying the DOM
- accessing system state

### Pure Functions does the following:

- Complete 1 task per function.
- Do not mutate state.
- Predictable and easy to test.
- Return something.

The goal of `Functional programming` is _not to make_ `functions pure` but to _minimize_ `side-effects` and write `predictable code`.

## Idempotence

Given the _same input_ to a function, it always _returns the same output_. The function could be _used over and over again_ and nothing changes. Another way to make code predictable.

## Imperative vs Declarative

`Imperative Programming` tells the computer what to do and how to complete it.
`Declarative Programming` only tells the computer what to do, but not how to do it.

This is important in `Functional Programming` because our code needs to be **more declarative** to better understand our code and let the _computer handle_ the dirty work of _figuring out what is the best way to do something_.

<!-- More Imperative -->

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

<!-- More Declarative -->

```
[1,2,3].forEach(i => console.log(i));
```

## Closures

In the below example, we are `modifying state(count)` outside of it's function scope.

```js
const closure = () => {
  let count = 0;
  return () => {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
};

const incrementFun = closure();

console.log("Incrementing Counter via Closure => ", incrementFun());
```

`incrementFun` is an `impure function` since it _modifies the closed over variable_.

Pure way to do it:

```
const closure = () => {
    let count = 0;
    return () => count;
}

const getCounter = closure();

console.log('Get Counter via Closure => ', getCounter());
```

Now we still have access to data outside it's scope.

## Currying

We can call a function with `fewer arguments` than it _expects_. It _returns a function_ that takes the `remaining arguments`.

In the below example, we have created a function that takes one argument and returns a function.The `returned function` remembers the first argument via **Closure**.

```
const curriedMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;

console.log('Multiply a number using Currying: ', curriedMultiply(3)(5))
```

## Partial Application

We take a function and _create a new function_ with one or more arguments **set/partially applied**.

`Partial Application` expects _all the arguments_ in the second call

```js
const add = (a, b, c) =>
  console.log("Adding using Partial Application => ", a + b + c);

const partialAdditionBy2 = add.bind(null, 2);
console.log(partialAdditionBy2);

partialAdditionBy2(4, 6);
```

### Currying vs Partial Application:

`Currying`: The number of curried/nested function depends on the number of the arguments.

## Memoization

If the `parameter` of a function _doesn't change_, its **memoized/cached**. Hence returns a cached version.

```js
function memoizedAddTo80(n) {
  if (n in cache) {
    console.log("Cached Input", n);
    return cache[n];
  } else {
    console.log("Long time...", n);
    cache[n] = n + 80;
    return cache[n];
  }
}
```

### Arity -> no of arguments a function take

## Exercise

f: `accumulator` , g: `currentFun`

```js
const compose =
  (f, g) =>
  (...args) => {
    console.log("F => ", f);
    console.log("G => ", g);
    f(g(...args));
  };

function purchaseItem(...funs) {
  return funs.reduce(compose);
}

const composedFun = purchaseItem(emptyCart, buyItem, applyTax, addItemToCart);

console.log(composedFun(user, new Item("jacket", 20)));
```

### Order of execution

1. emptyCart(buyItem(applyTax(addItemToCart)))
2. emptyCart(buyItem(applyTax))
3. emptyCart(buyItem)
4. emptyCart

### Tips to write Pure functions:

- They are self contained. Everything the function needs is handed to it on a silver platter.

- It does not depend on **System State** because it increases [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) by introducing an _external environment_.
